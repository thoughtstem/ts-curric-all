@title{ts-curric-all}

@section{General}

This repo lists as dependencies any curriculum we are currently intersted in.
Installing this repo as a racket package should pull in all current curriculum.
That, in turn, should pull in all langs and libraries that the curricula pertain to.

The intention is that installing @racket[ts-curric-all] will install everything
needed on a device that students are using.

The other intention is that it gives teachers and admins an easy way to access
the curriculum materials they need: i.e. for editing, printing, review, making
new curriculum based on existing curriculum, etc.

These docs will serve as generalized documentation on our curriculum organizational
structure as a
whole.  Docs specific to any particular curriculum should go in those particular repos.

@section{Printing}

Printing of quest cards is a common task.  Here's a reasonably fast way to get printable
sheets for the first quest, with enough duplicates for everyone enrolled in course 1225.
This will propt you to choose a folder to save the images into.  Then you can use
whatever program your OS gives you for layout/printing/etc.

  #lang racket

  (set-env! PROD)
